/**
 * WASM-backed adapter that mimics the legacy `BatchPirClient` API shape.
 *
 * The old `web/src/client.ts` carried ~800 LOC of PIR wire-format logic
 * (encoding batched DPF queries, decoding responses, per-bucket Merkle
 * verification). Session 3 of the TS retirement plan replaced that with
 * this adapter, which delegates the actual PIR work to `WasmDpfClient`
 * from `pir-sdk-wasm` (which in turn wraps the native Rust `DpfClient`
 * via the `wasm_transport` layer in `pir-sdk-client`).
 *
 * What stays in TypeScript:
 *   * A pair of side-channel `ManagedWebSocket`s — the WASM client owns
 *     its own transport sockets internally, but those aren't exposed to
 *     the browser. The side-channel sockets are used for:
 *       - `REQ_GET_INFO_JSON` for diagnostic details only. Catalog, Merkle
 *         availability, sync planning, and trusted roots all come from the
 *         post-upgrade native connection and installed proof handles.
 *   * Translation between `WasmQueryResult` (the WASM-side opaque
 *     handle) and the legacy `QueryResult` shape consumed by the UI
 *     renderers + `sync-merge.ts`.
 *
 * What moves to WASM:
 *   * All PIR wire-format logic (INDEX + CHUNK batched queries).
 *   * Per-bucket bin-Merkle verification before any result handle crosses
 *     the WASM boundary (`queryBatchVerified`).
 *   * Padding invariants (K=75 INDEX / K_CHUNK=80 CHUNK / 25-MERKLE) —
 *     owned by the native `DpfClient`, not re-implementable here.
 *
 * 🔒 Privacy: the adapter cannot bypass padding, cannot short-circuit the
 * symmetric INDEX bin probing (`INDEX_CUCKOO_NUM_HASHES = 2`), and cannot
 * turn off Merkle verification — those live in native Rust code below the
 * WASM boundary.
